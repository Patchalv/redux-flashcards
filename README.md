# Redux flashcard project

This app was completed as part of the Codecademy Full-stack Engineering bootcamp to practice using Redux toolkit. 

The objective of this project were to:

- configure individual slices modules using createSlice(); ('@reduxjs/toolkit')
- configure a store module wth configureStore() and the individual slice modules. ('@reduxjs/toolkit')
- use useSelector() in conjunction with the defined selectors in each individual state slices to access the Store; ('react-redux)
- create selector's to access the states for manipulation; ('react-redux')
- with useDispatch() dispatch actions to the store to update rendering; ('react-redux')
- understand the view => middleware => Action (dispatch) => view Redux workflow
